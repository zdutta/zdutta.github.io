## Reflection

> "If a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them."

A beautifully written novel about Count Alexander Rostov, sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol Hotel in Moscow. Over decades, he builds a life of meaning, friendship, and dignity within the hotel's walls.
